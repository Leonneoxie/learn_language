============================
 EDSAC Simulator on browser
============================

I think EDSAC is good to learn machine language,
because recent CPU is complex.

My goal is to make a Python version to run on console,
and a JavaScript version to run on browser.

**NOTICE**

This code is not complete yet.


Design
======

We now have plenty of memory than 1950s.
For easy learning and inspectation,
use memories in human-readable way.


TODO
====

- Try other sample to run
- I made 3 classes Value, WordValue, DoubleWordValue,
  however I feel it is better to use only one class 'Bits'

Reference
=========

- http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mr/edsacposter.pdf

  - code of initial order and square are come from this poster.
  - "11100 0 0000100010 0 62 S34S" seems typo of "01100 ..."
  - It said HnS is 'R += m[n]', however EdsacTG.pdf said it is 'R = m[n]'.
    If '+=' is correct, on '97: H76S', result is affected by value which stored on R during initial order.
    I choose 'R = m[n]'.
