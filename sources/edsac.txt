============================
 EDSAC Simulator on browser
============================

I think EDSAC is good to learn machine language,
because recent CPU is complex.

My goal is to make a Python version to run on console,
and a JavaScript version to run on browser.

**NOTICE**

This code is not complete yet.


Design
======

We now have plenty of memory than 1950s.
For easy learning and inspectation,
use memories in human-readable way.


TODO
====

- most high bit of tape is complemented. write test.
- complete "_test_initial_order()" (now on line 13)
